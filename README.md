# Coffee Machine Program

This is a simple coffee machine program implemented in Python. The program simulates a coffee machine that allows users to select different types of coffee, make payment, and receive their desired coffee if the required resources are available and the payment is sufficient.

## Features

- **Menu**: The coffee machine offers a menu with different types of coffee, including espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Each coffee has its own set of ingredients and cost associated with it.

- **Resource Management**: The program keeps track of available resources such as water, milk, and coffee. It checks if there are sufficient resources to make the selected coffee and deducts the required ingredients from the available resources upon successful preparation.

- **Payment System**: Users can make payment by entering the number of coins for each denomination (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). The program calculates the total amount and checks if the payment is sufficient for the selected coffee.

- **Change Calculation**: If the payment is more than the cost of the coffee, the program calculates the change and returns it to the user.

- **Reporting**: The coffee machine provides a report functionality that displays the current status of available resources (water, milk, coffee) and the total profit earned.
